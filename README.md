# ReactionTimeAnalysis
This repository, "Reaction-Time-Analysis-Affordance," is dedicated to the study of human reaction times in response to different levels of tool affordance and physical violation scenarios. Utilizing MATLAB for data analysis, it explores how congruence and incongruence between tools and their expected use affect reaction times.
